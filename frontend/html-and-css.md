# HTML & CSS

HTML and CSS make up webpages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and describes the structure of a web page by defining content as an image, or a box, or text. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and gives the content in your HTML file style. It beautifies your page - ex: font size/type, alignments, image size, color, shading, animations, etc
