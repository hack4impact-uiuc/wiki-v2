# Take Home Exercises

Our take-home exercises are **VERY** useful. Please do them. They are simpler versions of what you will be doing in your own project and will give you a good understanding of React and Flask. As you do them, remember to read the **ENTIRE** README because everything in it is very important. It is also named `README` so read it!
