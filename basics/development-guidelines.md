# Development Guidelines

Depending on your team, your Product Manager and/or Technical lead will be the gatekeepers of the master branch, reviewing all code before it gets merged. Each team will have their own styling guide, which is entirely dependent on the Tech lead. Your Javascript code may have prettier installed along with eslint to keep the styling consistent. However, we do expect you to follow good software engineering practice. Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Maintain Consistent Naming

2. Move reusable code into function

3. When editing an existing file, maintain the existing style as much as possible. This includes indenting, bracing, separator whitespace, etc.

4. Variables should be organized and almost never be global.

5. Provide function interfaces specifying what the function is doing and comment code with complicated logic
