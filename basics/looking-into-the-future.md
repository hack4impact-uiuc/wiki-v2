# Looking into the Future

This wiki is intended to be a live document and will be constantly updated as I have the time to do so. Some explorations we are currently doing:

* [**GraphQL**](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/wiki/wiki/graphql.org) - this is a relatively new Query Language open-sourced by Facebook. It rids of underfetching/overfetching of resources that happens a lot with a REST API. Other benefits of GraphQL are the ability to not have versioning, strong types, and a stable and universal specification compared to REST.
* **Node.js** - we are using Node.js as the implementation for a GraphQL server
* **NoSQL** - scalable and fast :\)

In addition, using Node.js and Express as a backend service instead of Flask is very plausible. I do mention its advantages [here](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/wiki/wiki/Flask-Intro), which will allow the team to be more flexible in where the members of the team can work on frontend or backend and switch back and forth. The code may be cleaner as well.... if you write it in standard conventions that we set up in the beginning. However, we will most likely use a NoSQL with this tech stack.
