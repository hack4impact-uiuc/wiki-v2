# Who we are

Hello there! 

We are the UIUC chapter of Hack4Impact National! Our Mission is to connect student developers with Non-profit Organizations to develop powerful tools to help non-profits further their mission and better engage their clients. We are committed to shipping the highest quality products to solve a core problem while providing our members with a unique opportunity to grow and learn as developers and as people. 

Each semester, we select 3-5 nonprofits and provide student teams of 4-7 with the opportunity to work with them. Each team is led by a product manager and technical lead and works closely with the nonprofit to build a great product that solves a core need. 

#### Our Core Values

* **Mentorship & Education** - At the heart of Hack4Impact, we aim to create an environment where we are always learning from our work and from others. Your Product Manager and Technical Lead will be your main sources of mentorship but don't count out your teammates either! As part of the team, you will learn how to identify user needs in order to design and build a working product. Youâ€™ll have a chance to experiment with and build new technologies and will go through a high-level workshop in the beginning that covers the technologies you may need to know.
* **Go For It** - Sometimes, the only way to learn if something works is to run with it. If we waited until our plans were perfect, we would never get anywhere. Great ideas can come from anyone and anywhere. We grow because we are always trying something new.
* **Be Dependable** - we trust every single member to hold themselves and others accountable. We know that our performance affects others. If we all are engaged and follow through on our commitments, then we can be confident that others have our backs.
