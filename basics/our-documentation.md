# Our Documentation

I highly, highly encourage you to read documentation and search through it before you ask someone about a problem. Many of the core problems and examples have been provided in our documentation. In addition, look through our previous projects that have similar tech stacks as your project. We do also provide many outside resources that we think are great for you to use.

#### Our Documentation Styling

* Whenever there's a `$` in front of blocked code, it means that it's a terminal command. If you open up the terminal, you would see a `$` in the very end of the line. This same principle applies to other characters, such as when you access the Postgres Command Line Interface, it would be `#`. Here's an example of going into the Postgres CLI and listing all the databases:

```text
$ psql
# \l
```

* Our Example Code will generally be styled in Markdown Format. They will not have any special character before them
* If you run into any troubles or confusion, please feel free to contact your PM/TL or me for assistance.
