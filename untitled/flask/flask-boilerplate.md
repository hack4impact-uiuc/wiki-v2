# Flask Boilerplate

As mentioned previously, Flask is a pretty neat framework that is pretty simple, allowing new developers to pick up very fast. However, it's simplicity comes with its disadvantages, mainly its lack of a Database ORM, standard application structure and code conventions. [Flask Boilerplate](https://github.com/tko22/flask-boilerplate) was made to fix this by implementing SQLAlchemy with Postgres for Database Interactions, Heroku for deployment, and Docker for development. For every backend API service, the application structure will the same across all teams that use Flask. Thus, developers may pick up different projects and immediately start working because they are already familiar with where each thing is located.

There you will see documentation for how to interact with postgres using SQLAlchemy, how blueprints work, how to setup everything, etc. You will find a lot of the information on how using Flask and the ORM there as well.
